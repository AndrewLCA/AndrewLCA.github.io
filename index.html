        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="IMG_0439.jpeg" alt = "Andrew Lu" class = "pfp">  
        <p>I’m a senior at the University of California, San Diego, studying Mathematics and Computer Science. 
            I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and playing video games in my free time. Currently, I work as an undergraduate 
            researcher and a Computer Science tutor. My research focuses on optimizing sparse matrix computations for high-performance 
            applications. I’m actively seeking new graduate software engineering roles</p>
